## Objectives

- Master ticket handling workflow in Odoo
- Practice professional communication (ticket responses + email drafts)
- Learn MindX's 7-step process and Class of Service framework
- Handle realistic support scenarios
- Build professional communication skills
- Prepare for Week 4 reporting and analysis

## Learning Approach: Practice-Based

Week 3 focuses on **hands-on practice** with real scenarios:

**Days 1-2: Ticket Operations**

- Odoo ticket system setup and workflow
- MindX 7-step process application
- Class of Service classification and decision making
- Practice: 6 ticket scenarios (01-06)

## MindX Framework (Simple)

**7 Steps:** Reception → Response → Diagnosis → Resolution → Updates → Follow-up → Analysis

**Class of Service:**

- Standard (< 5 users)
- Priority (5-25 users)
- Expedite (> 25 users)
- Fixed Deadline (time-driven)

**Tools:** Odoo for tickets, email (draft) for communication practice

## Week 3 Practice Scenarios

**Days 1-2: Ticket Handling (6 scenarios)**

- Login issue (Standard)
- Performance problem (Priority)
- Critical bug (Expedite)
- Feature request handling
- Multi-user issue
- Deadline-driven request

Each scenario: ~30-45 min, includes template and evaluation checklist.
