**Focus:** Practice on Odoo Helpdesk about ticket workflow through 6 scenarios (01-06) + email drafts per scenario

---

## 🔧 Sys Admin / DevOps Setup

**Required Access:**

- Odoo ticket system
- Azure App Insights (read-only)

### Recommended: Create an Odoo trial account

1. Odoo offers trial accounts on its official website. See pricing and trial options at: `https://www.odoo.com/vi_VN/pricing`.
2. Create a demo account (14-day trial) to practice if no access to an internal demo instance is provided.
3. Quick signup guide:
   - Visit `https://www.odoo.com/vi_VN/pricing` → select "Try now" or "Start Now".
   - Enter name, email, phone number and create a demo database.
   - Select the apps needed for your scenarios (Helpdesk / Project / CRM) or start with one app to get familiar.
4. Important training notes:
   - This is a **demo environment** — DO NOT contact real users or modify production data.
   - Submit practice results as screenshots or exported files (do not interact with real users).
   - For sample data, use Odoo's demo data feature or import/export sample datasets.

## Resources & Templates (complete)

### MindX 7-Step Process (Quick Reference)

1. **Reception**: Log ticket in Odoo system (within 15 minutes)
2. **Initial Response**: Acknowledge the request and communicate receipt within 30 minutes
3. **Diagnosis**: Investigate the issue, gather more info if needed
4. **Resolution**: Provide a fix or workaround; document actions
5. **Communication**: Update customer and stakeholders every 24 hours or as needed
6. **Follow-up**: Confirm with the customer that the solution worked
7. **Trend Analysis**: Document patterns for future improvement and share with the team

---

### Odoo Ticket Workflow

1. **Create Ticket**: Enter all relevant details (title, description, customer info, class of service, category, tags)
2. **Set Priority**: Assign priority based on class of service table
3. **Log Initial Response**: Record your acknowledgement and first communication
4. **Update Regularly**: Record diagnosis, updates, and any actions taken
5. **Document Resolution**: Add details about the solution and confirm customer satisfaction
6. **Close Ticket**: Move ticket to resolved/closed once confirmed

---

### Communication Templates

- Each scenario in the `scenarios/` folder includes:
  - **Acknowledgment email/message** to customer/requester
  - **Escalation message** templates for DevOps/Sys Admin, if needed
  - **Resolution/follow-up template** to confirm closure

**Find communication templates directly in each `scenario-xx-*.md` file. Adapt for email, Teams, or other tools as appropriate.**

---

### Escalation Guidance

- Escalate when:
  - The issue is beyond your technical or access scope
  - There is significant business impact (multiple users, critical services)
  - Security, data privacy, or compliance is involved
- Escalation steps:
  1. Gather and include all context: ticket #, summary, actions tried, error messages/logs, impact
  2. Use appropriate channel (e.g. Microsoft Teams message, email, or ticket transfer)
  3. Keep requester informed about escalation and next steps

---

### Additional Tips

- **Document everything:** Each step should be recorded in Odoo for auditability
- **Use tags/labels:** For filtering and reporting
- **Screenshots/exports:** Required for all deliverables—blur/redact sensitive info
- **Sample data:** Use only provided demo/sample data—never real user data in training

---

**For DETAILED, scenario-specific steps and communications, always refer to the corresponding files in the `scenarios/` folder. Each file contains instructions, context, and ready-to-use message templates.**
